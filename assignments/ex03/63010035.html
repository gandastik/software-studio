        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Thomas Cruise Mapother IV (born July 3, 1962) is an American actor and
          producer. One of the world's highest-paid actors, he has received
          various accolades, including an Honorary Palme d'Or and three Golden
          Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for four Academy Awards. His
          films have grossed over $4 billion in North America and over $11.5
          billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing box-office
          stars of all time. Cruise began acting in the early 1980s and made his
          breakthrough with leading roles in the comedy film Risky Business
          (1983) and action film Top Gun (1986). Critical acclaim came with his
          roles in the dramas The Color of Money (1986), Rain Man (1988), and
          Born on the Fourth of July (1989). For his portrayal of Ron Kovic in

        <h2>Early life and education</h2>
        <p>
          Cruise was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, to electrical
          engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother III (1934â€“1984) and special education
          teacher Mary Lee (nÃ©e Pfeiffer; 1936â€“2017). His parents were both from
          Louisville, Kentucky, and had English, German, and Irish ancestry.[8]
          Cruise has three sisters named Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. One of his
          cousins, William Mapother, is also an actor who has appeared alongside
          Cruise in five films. Cruise grew up in near poverty and had a
          Catholic upbringing. He later described his father as "a merchant of
          chaos", a "bully", and a "coward" who beat his children. He
          elaborated, "[My father] was the kind of person where, if something
          goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my lifeâ€”how he'd
          lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like,
          'There's something wrong with this guy. Don't trust him. Be careful
          around him.'" In total, Cruise attended 15 schools in 14 years. Cruise
          spent part of his childhood in Canada; when his father took a job as a
          defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces, his family moved in
          late 1971 to Beacon Hill, Ottawa. He attended the new Robert Hopkins
          Public School for his fourth and fifth grade education. He first
          became involved in drama in fourth grade, under drama teacher George
          Steinburg. He and six other boys put on an improvised play to music
          called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival. Drama
          organizer Val Wright was in the audience and later said that "the
          movement and improvisation were excellent ... a classic ensemble
          piece." In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in
          Ottawa. That year, his mother left his father, taking Cruise and his
          sisters back to the United States. In 1978, she married Jack South.
          Cruise's biological father died of cancer in 1984. Cruise briefly took
          a Catholic Church scholarship and attended the St. Francis Seminary in
          Cincinnati, Ohio; he aspired to become a Franciscan priest before
          being expelled from the seminary for drinking. This led to his
          becoming interested in acting.:â€Š24â€“26â€Š In his senior year of high
          school, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but
          was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a
          game.:â€Š47â€Š He went on to star in the school's production of Guys and
          Dolls. In 1980, he graduated from Glen Ridge High School in Glen
          Ridge, New Jersey.[

          Cruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form
          Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993,[75] and the company has since
          co-produced several of Cruise's films, the first being Mission:
          Impossible in 1996 which was also Cruise's first project as a
          producer. Cruise in 2016 Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of
          the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005
          by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as "one of the most powerful
          â€“ and richest â€“ forces in Hollywood." Epstein argues that Cruise is
          one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven
          Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee
          the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends
          that the public obsession with Cruise's tabloid controversies obscures
          full appreciation of Cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.[76]
          Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise's film production company, is said
          to be developing a screenplay based on Erik Larson's New York Times
          bestseller The Devil in the White City about a real-life serial
          killer, H. H. Holmes, at Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition.
          Kathryn Bigelow is attached to the project to produce and helm.
          Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio's production company, Appian Way, is also
          developing a film about Holmes and the World's Fair, in which DiCaprio
          will star.[77] Cruise has produced several films in which he appeared.
          He produced Mission: Impossible, Without Limits, Mission: Impossible
          2, The Others, Vanilla Sky and many others.[78]

        <h2>Litigation</h2>
        <p>
          in 1998, Cruise successfully sued the Daily Express, a British tabloid
          which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover
          up his homosexuality.[157] In May 2001, Cruise filed a lawsuit against
          gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had told the celebrity magazine
          Actustar that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This
          claim was strongly denied by Cruise,[158] and Slater was later ordered
          to pay $10 million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could
          not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore
          default. Cruise requested a default judgment and, in January 2003, a
          Los Angeles judge decided against Slater after the porn actor said
          that his story was false.[159][160] Cruise also sued Bold Magazine
          publisher Michael Davis for $100 million, because Davis had alleged
          (though never confirmed) that he had video that would prove Cruise was
          gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis
          that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was
          heterosexual.[161] In 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to
          obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar,
          the domain redirected to information about Cruise on
          Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise
          was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
          on July 5, 2006.[162] In 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit
          charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise's behest. That
          suit was dismissed by a Central Civil West court judge in Los Angeles
          on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired on Sapir's
          claim.[163][164] In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against In
          Touch and Life & Style magazines for defamation after they claimed
          Cruise had "abandoned" his six-year-old daughter.[165] During
          deposition, Cruise testified that due to his work load 110 days had
          passed without his seeing her. The suit was ultimately settled between
          the two parties.[166][167]
